# Time Needed to Inform All Employees
# Question: A company has n employees with unique IDs from 0 to n - 1. The head of the company has the ID headID.
#
# You will receive a managers array where managers[i] is the ID of the manager for employee i. Each employee has one
# direct manager. The company head has no manager (managers[headID] = -1). Itâ€™s guaranteed the subordination
# relationships will have a tree structure.
#
# The head of the company wants to inform all employees of the news. He will inform his direct subordinates who will
# inform their direct subordinates and so on until everyone knows the news.
#
# You will receive an informTime array where informTime[i] is the time it takes for employee i to inform all their
# direct subordinates. Return the total number of minutes it takes to inform all employees of the news.

# Ex.:
# n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0] --> 0
# n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2], informTime = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] --> 1
# n = 8, headID = 1, manager = [1, -1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 2, 6], informTime = [3, 10, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0] --> 17
# n = 15, head_id = 0, manager = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6],
# informTime = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] --> 3
